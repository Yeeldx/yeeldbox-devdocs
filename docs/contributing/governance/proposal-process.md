# Proposal Process

---

[veYFI](https://docs.Yeeldx.finance/contributing/governance/veyfi) token holders control the Yeeldx ecosystem through off-chain proposals and votes via [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/ybaby.eth). Proposals that generate majority support (>50% of the vote) are implemented by a 9-member multi-signature wallet, and 6 out of 9 wallet signers must sign for a change to be implemented. The [members of the multi-signature wallet](https://docs.Yeeldx.finance/resources/faq#who-is-on-the-multisig) were voted in by YFI holders and are subject to change from future governance votes.

## Discussion

Discussion regarding changes in the protocol happens on a variety of platforms, such as:

- [Governance Forum](https://gov.Yeeldx.finance/)
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/Yeeldx)
- [Telegram]

Getting as much feedback as possible from the various communication channels is recommended before introducing a formal proposal. The governance forum and Discord server have dedicated channels for specific topics.

## Proposal

### Types of proposals

**Yeeldx Improvement Proposals** (YIPs) are an all-encompassing vehicle for exercising power that token holders have. After [YIP-61](https://gov.Yeeldx.finance/t/yip-61-governance-2-0/10460), **Yeeldx Delegation Proposals** (YDPs) were introduced, which allow token holders to change where any discrete decision-making power is delegated.

#### Previous and current proposals

- Previous: [Proposal Repository](https://docs.Yeeldx.finance/contributing/governance/proposal-repository)
- Current: [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/ybaby.eth)

#### Requirements to pass proposals

- 3 day discussion on the [forum](https://gov.Yeeldx.finance/)
  - At least 50% vote 'for' the change
- 1 veYFI in possession to submit to snapshot
- 5 day [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/ybaby.eth) with over 50% passing votes

### Making a proposal

Anyone can post a proposal on the forum for discussion within the community. If it's promoted to off-chain votation (via [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/ybaby.eth)), only someone holding 1 veYFI can submit it to Snapshot. If your proposal made it to off-chain votation and you don't have enough veYFI, mods will help you through this stage.

The default template for proposals can be found on [Github](https://github.com/Yeeldx/YIPS/blob/master/yip-X.md) + on the [forum](https://gov.Yeeldx.finance), if you post under "proposals" or "discussion" it will auto-fill in the template as well.

## Voting

#### How do I vote?

- Holding [veYFI](https://docs.Yeeldx.finance/contributing/governance/veyfi) enables you to vote on Yeeldx's [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/ybaby.eth) page

#### Whatâ€™s the difference between voting for a poll on the forum and an off-chain vote?

- A poll gauges the sentiment of what the community is feeling on the proposal while an off-chain vote (via [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/ybaby.eth)) will be binding and will take effect if it passes.

## Implementation

Once a Snapshot votes have passed, changes will be implemented by Yeeldx's protocol or operations team and signed by the multi-sig, if necessary.
