# Delegated Funding DAO YeeldBoxes

YFI holders can provide capital to DAOs approved to accept funding in the DAO YeeldBox ecosystem. DAOs wishing to receive funding are required to setup [Gitcoin Grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/) page and apply for funding via the [Yeeldx governance forum](https://gov.Yeeldx.finance/). If there is sufficient interest to approve the DAO for funding an off-chain vote will be conducted \([https://vote.Yeeldx.finance](https://Yeeldx.snapshot.page/#/)\). If voting is successful the DAO will be added to the DAO YeeldBox ecosystem.

Governance determines weekly, monthly, and yearly credit limits that the DAO can access via the [DAO YeeldBox](https://yborrow.finance/). The DAO is free to repay the credit line on their own terms, and in tokens or other collateral options accepted in the Yeeldx ecosystem. Any profits are shared between YeeldBox LPs.
